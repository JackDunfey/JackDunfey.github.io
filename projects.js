        summary: "I oversaw a team of 5 students to develop software for a robot that competed in the 2022 FIRST Robotics Competition (comparable to robot basketball). I was primarily responsible for the autonomous operation of the robot and the robot's vision system, which was used to detect and track game pieces, enable the robot to shoot and score dynamically. This system also used UDB to provide a live camera feed to the driver while maintaining a low bandwidth.",
